  <h2>Digital Title Project</h2>
  <img src="images/mairead_title_project.png" width="700" height="450" alt="HTML Dog" class="center">
<p> My main goal in making this title project was to be able to depict a warmness in my design. I've been told that I give off a warm, welcoming energy. I like to laugh and I like to make other people laugh. I ended up choosing doodles of stars and mixing that with a purplish pink sunset. I think that the stars do a really good job at showing what I was going for. Stars are literally burning balls of fire/energy so I thought they would be a good representation of my personality. For the font, I decided to take a simple font and then curve out the edges. I think this adds to the happy aura of my design. </p>


<h2>Twine Game: "Change is Coming"</h2>

<p> I decided to make my game centered around the theme of climate change. I wanted to take what I've been learning in my humanities class and apply it to something that could possibly raise more awareness about the situation. It blows my mind how creative people can get when they want something to be done. I went to the Youth Climate Strike in Chicago this past September. I was in awe of the different creations people made for the strike. I figured, "Why not create a game about it?" I call this game "Change is Coming" because that was what Greta Thunberg said at the end of one of her most recent speeches. In the game, you are a ball (you later find out that this ball represents the Earth) that has arrived on Planet B. The native species of Planet B are the Snamuhs (humans spelled backwards). The young Snamuhs have a different idea of what to do with you than the older Snamuhs. Through a somewhat terrifying adventure, you're jailed by the older Snamuhs and all of your resources are drained from you. A young Snamuh breaks into the jail and tries to set you free but the older Snamuhs stop them at the door. In a powerful speech, the young Snamuh tries to talk some sense into the older Snamuhs. The game ends with you having the option to say "yes" or "no" to joining the young Snamuh on their journey towards saving the ball. Clicking "no" would take you back to the beginning. Unfortunately, clicking "yes" would do the same thing because the older Snamuhs don't believe you. Hmmm...sounds kind of familiar, no? </p>

<h1>Collected Works</h1>

<body>

<h2> "Watercolor Lake" | 2018 </h2>
  <img src="images/watercolor lake.JPG" width="675" height="400" alt="HTML Dog" class="lake">
<p> This piece was my first ever experience with watercolor. I took a class at the Dupage Art League in the summer of 2018 and fell in love with this medium.</p>

<h2> "Just Breathe" | 2018 </h2>
  <img src="images/breathe.JPG" width="400" height="700" alt="HTML Dog" class="breathe">
<p> I will always hold this project very close to my heart. I took a multi-media art class during my senior year of high school. For one of the projects, we had to carve out our own design that we wanted to make prints of. I chose to make a design of ribs with the word "Breathe" above it. My lung spontaneously collapsed during the winter of my junior year. I ended up having to get bilaterial lung surgery. Since it was such a traumatic event, I felt like I needed to give myself a reason for why it happened. I took it as a sign to slow down. To stop rushing through life and to just BREATHE - because there was once I time when I almost couldn't.</p>

<h2> "Inkheart" | 2017 </h2>
  <img src="images/inheart.JPG" width="400" height="575" alt="HTML Dog"class="ink">
<p> It was this piece that made me realize my passion for ink artwork. I always hated coloring things in when I was growing up but I thought that was the only way to add demension to my work. Quil in hand, I spent hours on this project. I discovered that there are other ways to add depth and texture to my art. This piece actually started off horizontally. I had finished the project and turned it in when my teacher asked if I had tried turing it to its side. And voila! I drew a heart-looking-thing without realizing. </p>

<h2> "The Life of an American" | 2018 </h2>
  <img src="images/collage.JPG" width="400" height="500" alt="HTML Dog"class="gun">
<p> This piece was inspired by the March for Our Lives movement. It's something I'm really passionate about. Lots of hidden symbols in here. Take your time to digest it.</p>

<h2> "This is the Life" | 2018 </h2>
  <img src="images/sound piece.JPG" width="400" height="300" alt="HTML Dog"class="life">
<p> I had a lot of fun making this piece. The project was centered around listening to a song and then painting, drawing, and writing what you heard. At first it was a bit frustrating but once I let go, I had a great time making it. For this piece, I was listening to "This is the Life" by Two Door Cinema Club. If you haven't heard it, I would highly recommend listening to it. Everytime I hear it, it reminds me of summer time car rides with friends and family. </p>

<h2> Cyanotype | 2019 </h2>
  <img src="images/swimming pool.JPG" width="400" height="300" alt="HTML Dog"class="cyanotype">
<p> I made this cyanotype in my senior year photography class. We first chose a picture, elevated the contrast, inverted it, printed it on film, taped the film to a piece of glass, and then placed a piece of thick paper coated in developing fluid behind it. We all went outside and held our piece of glass up to the sun until it looked developed. Then we went inside and put it in some more myseterious liquids and ta-da! Final product. This is a picture of the Union League Club pool in Chicago.
</p>

<h2> "Explosion Space" | 2018 </h2>
  <img src="images/space explosion.JPG" width="400" height="500" alt="HTML Dog"class="space">
<p> Another ink piece. I made this one while watching a movie...about space. I drew a few circles and kind of just went with it. </p>

<h2> "Web Rainbow" | 2018 </h2>
  <img src="images/rainbow pattern.JPG" width="400" height="500" alt="HTML Dog"class="web">
<p> This piece was an interesting process. I started by created an ombre rainbow background with oil pastels. Then I used a pencil to carve out the web-like designs. It was tedious but I really like the way it turned it out. It's kind of mesmerizing.</p>

<h2> Abstract Painting | 2019 </h2>
  <img src="images/paint abstract.JPG" width="400" height="500" alt="HTML Dog"class="abstract">
<p> I made this painting at an event in my resident hall this past fall. I didn't really start with a plan so I ended up wiping the canvas five different times before I decided to make it abstract.</p>

<h2> Flower Sketch | 2018 </h2>
  <img src="images/flower sketch.JPG" width="400" height="300" alt="HTML Dog"class="flower">
<p> I made this sketch while I was in the hospital for lung surgery. My friend Mackenzie brought me a whole pack of Prismacolor colored pencils and this is the first thing I drew with them. </p>

<h2> "Fright Night" | 2019 </h2>
  <img src="images/funky picture.JPG" width="425" height="300" alt="HTML Dog" class="fright">
<p> I took this picture while I was at Six Flags during Fright Fest this past fall. I saw the neon lights and a cool puddle and was immediately inspired. My photography class taught me to find something extraordinary in ordinary things. The unit we did about complex photos also taught me that reflections can make a simple photo, for lack of a better word, complex. </p>
